            <p> Lima its one of the provinces of Per√∫, Its more 
                than anything the capital of the country. Lima 
                is characterized for being close to the coast 
                and have tropical weather, but also because for
                most of the year Lima's weather its foggy, many 
                of the people would rather live in an eternal 
                winter than summer, because when its summer here 
                we get to have the most elevated temperatures.
